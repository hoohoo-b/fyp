ALL means all the edges are involved.
LARGER THAN 0 means those edges with probability of 0 are not included. Similarly the NOT SMALLER THAN 0.5 contains only the edges has probability not smaller than 0.5. 

You can select what kinds of edges to display by modifying the 169-177 lines in cluster_scc.py.
Please be informed that you need to remove the "," of the last entry in each part of .json file manually , e.g. at the end of "nodes" part. Sry for my laziness when coding this part^-^. You can do some change yourself.
